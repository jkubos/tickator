What is Tickator
================

Tickator is an attempt to implement unusual parallel computation model. Model, that is way different that multithreading, functional programming, actors, fork-join, Disruptor, you-name-it.

Tickator is composed of components called Ticklets with input and output ports. Ticklets are then connected to each other.
