Architecture described
==================================

Documentation in section [What is tickator](/articles/what-is-tickator) and [Architecture](/articles/architecture) has been finished. So now you can finally get some theoretical information about Tickator project. Please let me know if anything is hard to understand. You can [report issue](https://github.com/jkubos/tickator/issues) on GitHub.

Let's roll up sleeves and jump into implementation. **Stay tuned!**
